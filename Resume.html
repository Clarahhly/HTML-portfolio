    <h3>Coding Experience</h3>
    <h4>UniMelb COMP20008 Final Project</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilized Python and libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib for data cleaning and preprocessing</li>
        <li>Implemented a decision tree classifier with entropy-based splitting and backward feature elimination,
            achieving 55.5% accuracy.</li>
        <li>Applied linear regression to uncover key predictors of popularity</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>UniMelb SWEN20003 Final Project</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a Java-based music arcade game, ShadowDance, implementing multiple game levels with
            increasing complexity, inspired by Dance Dance Revolution.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a modular game architecture using object-oriented principles, ensuring code
            reusability and scalability
        </li>
        <li>Managed project timelines and version control using GitLab, ensuring on-time delivery and adherence to
            coding standards
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Unimelb SWEN 30006 Projects</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Refactored and extended the codebase for a mining simulation and a card game, improving design and
            adding new features while maintaining original functionality.</li>
        <li>Utilized object-oriented design principles (GRASP, GoF) to redesign systems for better maintainability
            and scalability</li>
        <li>Managed the full project lifecycle, including design analysis, software modeling, and code
            implementation. Delivered well-documented code, detailed design reports, and software models,
            ensuring clear communication of design decisions and facilitating future development.</li>
    </ul>
